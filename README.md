# Crepuscular games

A games site using Rails + Actioncable to make a series of interconnected multiplayer online games. Users earn points that they can use to purchase items in an in-game shop, and those items can be used in other games.

Currently, players are able to play tic-tac-toe with one another and play a slot machine.

They are able to buy eggs that hatch into pets, and feed the pets.

In production: a mini Terraria-style mining game in which players can collaboratively build a small world, and mine it for materials that they will be able to sell, and eventually also craft into other materials.
